name: Intervention
description: An area that contains personalised content to the user
body: |
  The intervention is used to show personalised content. For instance, if the user has visited multiple
  pages in the same area of the site, we might want let them know that there are other pages on GOV.UK
  that would be useful to them. This component would be used to add this personalised content and would
  indicate to the user that this is not normally part of the page, but has been added for them specifically.

  Right now the contents of the component are static, as the MVP of personalised content is only for Start a Business.
  Since many pages will use this component with the same text, we hard-code it here for now.

  The dismiss link will reload the page but the `hide-intervention` query string parameter will cause the
  backed not to show the intervention again. Some progressive enhancement will be added in later to avoid
  reloading the page if JavaScript is available.
