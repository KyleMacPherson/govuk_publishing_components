description: "Navigational breadcrumbs, showing page hierarchy"

  Accepts an array of breadcrumb objects. Each crumb must have a title and a URL.
  Links have tracking data but links to the homepage (any link with a url of "/") will be tracked separately as `homeLinkClicked`

  Note: Only the first and last (or parent) item in the breadcrumb will be displayed when the page width is less than the "tablet" govuk-breakpoint.
