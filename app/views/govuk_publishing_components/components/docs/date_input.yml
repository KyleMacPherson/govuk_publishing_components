name: Form date input
description: Use the date input component to help users enter a memorable date or one they can easily look up.
accessibility_criteria: |
  Inputs in the component must:

  * accept focus
  * be focusable with a keyboard
  * be usable with a keyboard
  * be usable with touch
  * indicate when they have focus
  * be recognisable as form input elements
  * have correctly associated labels
  * be of the appropriate type for their use, e.g. password inputs should be of type 'password'

  Labels use the [label component](/component-guide/label).

  Avoid using autofocus and tabindex unless you have user research to support this behaviour.
