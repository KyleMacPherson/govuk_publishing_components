      This option changes the feed link to a toggle control, which opens a hidden element containing an input prepopulated with the value passed to the component, usually a URL to an atom feed. This uses the [form input](/component-guide/input) component.

      Note that this option overrides the feed_link option, so if both are passed feed_link is ignored. Note that a value for email_signup_link can also be passed as normal.
