    data:
      email_signup_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore/email-signup'
      feed_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore.atom'
  with_margin:
    description: The component accepts a number for margin bottom from 0 to 9 (0px to 60px) using the [GOV.UK Frontend spacing scale](http://govuk-frontend-review.herokuapp.com/docs/#settings/spacing-variable-govuk-spacing-points). It defaults to having no margin bottom, although some margin is supplied by the links themselves (so that when they stack on mobile there is space between them).
    data:
      email_signup_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore/email-signup'
      feed_link: '/foreign-travel-advice/singapore.atom'

  with_copyable_feed_link:
    description: |
      This option changes the feed link to a toggle control, which opens a hidden element containing an input prepopulated with the value passed to the component, usually a URL to an atom feed. This uses the [form input](/component-guide/input) component.

      Note that this option overrides the feed_link option, so if both are passed feed_link is ignored. Note that a value for email_signup_link can also be passed as normal.
