name: Attachment link (experimental)
description: A link to a file with metadata of the file contents
body: |
  This component is marked as experimental as it is part of a drive to provide
  a consistent place for attachment presentation logic (currently this logic is
  within [Govspeak][] and [Whitehall][]). The API for this
  component may change during this process.

  It provides a means to show a link to an attachment with some
  relevant file data.

  It is expected to be embedded inside an element that provides text styles
  (such as `.govuk-body`) so does not provide its own text styling.
