name: Form checkboxes
description: Let users select one or more options by using the checkboxes component.
body: This component uses [Checkbox component](/component-guide/checkbox).
govuk_frontend_components:
  - checkboxes
accessibility_criteria: |
  The component must:

  - accept focus
  - be focusable with a keyboard
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - be usable with touch
  - indicate when they have focus
  - have correctly associated labels
  - have a legend (see below)

  Labels use the [label component](/component-guide/label).

  Checkboxes in a fieldset require a legend. The text of the legend is passed using the 'heading' option. If no heading is passed, no legend is shown, which causes an accessibility error. You must pass a heading when using this component, or provide other measures to ensure accessibility.
