name: Share links
description: Links to share the current page on Facebook or Twitter
body: |
  Pass complete share URLs to the component. The component will not process a URL into a share link itself.

  Use only with content that benefits from being shared, for example a consultation.

  The component will track interactions with the share links to Google Analytics using [Social Interactions](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/social-interactions)

  Real world examples:

    - [News article](/government/news/fast-tracking-uk-innovation-apply-for-business-funding)
    - [Consultation](/government/consultations/soft-drinks-industry-levy)
    - [Right to left](/government/news/uk-sets-out-long-term-support-for-stable-secure-and-prosperous-afghanistan-to-2020.ur)
