name: Step by step navigation
description: A series of expanding/collapsing steps designed to navigate a user through a process
body: |
  Step by step navigations show a sequence of steps towards a specific goal, such as 'learning to drive'. Each step can contain one or more links to pages. User research suggested that each step should be collapsed by default so that users are not overwhelmed with information.

  If JavaScript is disabled the step by step navigation expands fully. All of the functionality (including the icons and aria attributes) are added using JavaScript.

  This component is based on the accordion component in collections, but has been altered. This is for two reasons.

  - step by step navigations are needed throughout GOV.UK and extending the accordion to be this component would require it to be moved out of that application, which would break integration testing
  - creating a new component allows further iteration without impacting the accordion

  Background information relating to the testing and research behind this component can be found on the [Modelling Services wiki](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MS/pages) in Q2 to Q4, 2017/18.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The step by step navigation must:

  - indicate to users that each step can be expanded and collapsed
  - inform the user when a step has been expanded or collapsed
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - allow users to show or hide all steps at once
  - inform the user which step a link belongs to
  - inform the user which step the current page is in
  - be readable when only the text of the page is zoomed - achieved for the numbers and logic elements by their text being wrapped in several elements that give them a white background and ensure the text when zoomed expands to the left, not to the right, where it would obscure the step titles

  The show/hide all button only needs to list the first panel id in the aria-controls attribute, rather than all of them.

  Step headings must use a button element:

  - so that steps can be toggled with the space and enter keys
  - so that steps can't be opened in a new tab or window

  When JavaScript is unavailable the component must:

  - be fully expanded
  - not be marked as expandable

  with_unique_tracking:
    description: |
      In order to identify the step by step navigation the component is part of, we need to track a unique ID of the navigation in Google Analytics. This ID should be the same across all pages that are linked from and are part of that navigation. Its value is included in any tracking events, specifically in dimension96. It refers to the ID of the step nav page.

      This includes show/hide all, show/hide step and any link clicks.

  solve_the_double_dot_problem:
    description: |
      As shown, options can be passed to the component to highlight one step, expand one step by default, and highlight multiple links. These options should only be used when the component is in the sidebar. The step that is highlighted and expanded will be referred to as the active step (even though they are separate options, it is assumed that they will normally be applied to the same step).

      If a link is in a step by step navigation more than once and the user is on that page, the backend doesn't know which link to highlight, so it highlights both of them.

      JavaScript is included in the component to solve this. It uses sessionStorage to capture the data-position attribute of non-external links when clicked, and then uses this value to decide which link to highlight after the new page loads. It uses the value of the tracking_id option to uniquely identify the current step nav in the session (if this is not passed to the component this may result in other step navs having the wrong link highlighted).

      If a user has not clicked a link (i.e. has visited the page without first clicking on a step by step navigation) only the first duplicate link will be highlighted. If that link is not in the active step, the JS makes the highlighted link's parent the active step. If there is no active step, the first active link will be highlighted (but there should always be an active step).

      The example below will show all non-external links highlighted if JS is disabled. In the real world no more than two or three links are likely to be highlighted at once.

      Changes to the active step and highlighted link are also applied on click, if the user clicks one of the other links that is to the same page (they are amended by the component to be jump links to the top of the page). Open this example using the 'preview' link and try clicking on the 'internal' links to see how it behaves.

    description: |
      Steps can be optional. This is controlled by two parameters, 'optional' and 'logic'.

      - Optional steps used to have a dotted line down the side but this was removed as it confused users. In some cases we may still need to record if a step is optional, so if this parameter is applied, GA tracking events will have 'optional' appended to the end of the eventLabel.
      - Logic will change the number next to a step to the word 'and' or the word 'or'.

      If a step is optional this should be conveyed by the text within that step.
