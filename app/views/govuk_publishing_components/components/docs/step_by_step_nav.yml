name: Step by step navigation
description: A series of expanding/collapsing steps designed to navigate a user through a process
body: |
  Step by step navigations show a sequence of steps towards a specific goal, such as 'learning to drive'. Each step can contain one or more links to pages. User research suggested that each step should be collapsed by default so that users are not overwhelmed with information.

  If JavaScript is disabled the step by step navigation expands fully. All of the functionality (including the icons and aria attributes) are added using JavaScript.

  This component is based on the accordion component in collections, but has been altered. This is for two reasons.

  - step by step navigations are needed throughout GOV.UK and extending the accordion to be this component would require it to be moved out of that application, which would break integration testing
  - creating a new component allows further iteration without impacting the accordion
accessibility_criteria: |
  The step by step navigation must:

  - indicate to users that each step can be expanded and collapsed
  - inform the user when a step has been expanded or collapsed
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - allow users to show or hide all steps at once
  - inform the user which step a link belongs to
  - inform the user which step the current page is in
  - be readable when only the text of the page is zoomed - achieved for the numbers and logic elements by their text being wrapped in several elements that give them a white background and ensure the text when zoomed expands to the left, not to the right, where it would obscure the step titles

  The show/hide all button only needs to list the first panel id in the aria-controls attribute, rather than all of them.

  Step headings must use a button element:

  - so that steps can be toggled with the space and enter keys
  - so that steps can't be opened in a new tab or window

  When JavaScript is unavailable the component must:

  - be fully expanded
  - not be marked as expandable

  remember_last_opened_step:
    description: |
      If a step is opened its ID is appended to the end of the URL, so that if the URL is shared or the 'back' button is used, that step will be opened on page load. This was historically part of the behaviour of the accordion. By default this is turned off and cannot be used together with the option to open a step by default.

      This behaviour is used with the 'links to more information' option.

      - context, an optional text field to show some extra information after the link, usually a monetary value
      - active, whether to make the link highlighted (to indicate the current page)
      - highlight_step, a general option to highlight the step. Usually the active link would be in the active step, but in some circumstances there might be an active step but no highlighted link.

  solve_the_double_dot_problem:
    description: |
      If a page is in a step by step navigation more than once and a user is viewing that URL, both links to it will be highlighted as the site has no way to know which link the user is currently viewing (highlighted links should only occur when the step by step navigation is in the sidebar).

      JavaScript is included in the component to solve this. It uses sessionStorage to capture the data-position attribute of non-external links when clicked, and then uses this value to decide which link to highlight when the new page loads. This session storage data is immediately deleted after it is read on page load, mainly to prevent problems with highlighting if the user were to move between different step by step navigations.

      If a user has not clicked a link (i.e. has visited the page without first clicking on a step by step navigation) the first active link in the first active step will be highlighted. If there is no active step, the first active link will be highlighted (but there should always be an active step).

      The current page in the step by step navigation is an anchor link to the top of the page. If there are more than one of these and the user clicks one that is not currently highlighted, that one will be highlighted.

      The example below will show all links highlighted if JS is disabled, in the real world no more than two or three links are likely to be highlighted at once.

  with_optional_steps:
    description: |
      Steps can be optional. This is controlled by two parameters, 'optional' and 'logic'.

      - Optional steps used to have a dotted line down the side but this was removed as it confused users. In some cases we may still need to record if a step is optional, so if this parameter is applied, GA tracking events will have 'optional' appended to the end of the eventLabel.
      - Logic will change the number next to a step to the word 'and' or the word 'or'.

      If a step is optional this should be conveyed by the text within that step.

      Get help links will only appear if the step_nav_url global parameter is set and the step itself has the optional show_help_link parameter set to true.
