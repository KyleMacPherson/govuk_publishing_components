body: |
  A heading tag with an optional id attribute, used predominantly to the left of content on consultations and publications.

  Real world examples:

  - [Publication](/government/publications/recognising-the-terrorist-threat)
  - [Consultation](/government/consultations/proposal-for-the-future-of-rotherham-goldthorpe-jobcentre)
accessibility_criteria: |
  The heading must:

  - be part of a correct heading structure for a page
  - be semantically represented as a heading
  - convey the heading level
examples:
  default:
    data:
      text: 'Download the full outcome'
  specific_heading_level:
    data:
      text: 'Original consultation'
      heading_level: 3
  with_id_attribute:
    data:
      text: 'Detail of outcome'
      id: 'detail_of_outcome'
  right_to_left:
    data:
      text: 'مستندات'
    context:
      right_to_left: true
  with_mobile_top_margin:
    description: |
      On publications and consultations the layout of the page requires that the heading component have spacing above it on mobile. Since this is a specific use case, this is now an option on the component rather than the default behaviour.

      It is intended that this option will ultimately be deprecated once more of the frontend is componentised and a general component model of margins is implemented.
    data:
      text: 'Consultation description'
      mobile_top_margin: true
