name: Taxonomy list
description: Wraps the highlight box, document list and image card components in one list. This is commonly used on topic pages for links to tagged content.
body: |
  The [highlight box](/component-guide/highlight_boxes), [document list](/component-guide/document_list) and [image card](/component-guide/image_card) components are standalone components.

  However, there are some use cases where we want to use these components together to render one list of links. This is not possible when using the components separately.
  This component wraps these components in one list, and applies relevant styling to get them to display appropriately together.

  **Note:** At the moment, this component only works when displaying either highlight box + document list **or** image cards + document list. The layout for combining all three together hasn't been fixed.
