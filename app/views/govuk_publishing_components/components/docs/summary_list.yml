  with_custom_link_on_section:
    description: |
      Take care that the provided `link_text` still makes sense to screen readers when combined with the title.
      For instance, `Reorder` link text and `Items` title becomes `Reorder Items`, which reads fine, but link text
      of `Summary` would read as `Summary Items`, which does not make sense.

      Otherwise, pass an explicit title attribute for the link, as shown in previous examples.
    data:
      edit:
        href: "custom-link"
        link_text: "Reorder"
      title: "Items"
