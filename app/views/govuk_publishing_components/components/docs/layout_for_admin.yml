name: Admin layout (experimental)
description: A layout to be used by admin applications
body: |
  This component is experimental. Breaking changes are likely and we'll not release
  major version of the gem for these changes. Typically you'll use this together
  with the [layout header component](/component-guide/layout_header) and the
  [layout footer component](/component-guide/layout_footer).

  Because it is an entire HTML document, this component can only be [previewed on a separate page](/admin).

  Inside this component you can use a number of classes provided by govuk-frontend:

  - [Typography classes](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/) like `.govuk-link`, `.govuk-heading`
  - [Layout grid classes](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/) like `.govuk-grid-column-two-thirds`
  - [Spacing classes](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/) like `.govuk-!-margin-bottom-3`
  - The `.govuk-visually-hidden` class to hide things

  Be *very* careful when using one of these classes, prefer to use a component
  instead of consuming govuk-frontend directly.
