name: Admin layout (experimental)
description: A layout to be used by admin applications
body: |
  This component is experimental. Breaking changes are likely and we'll not release
  major version of the gem for these changes.

  Because it is an entire layout, this component can only be [previewed on a separate page](/admin).

  Typically you'll use this together with:

  - the [layout header component](/component-guide/layout_header)
  - the [layout footer component](/component-guide/layout_footer)

display_preview: false
display_html: true

      environment: production
      product_name: Publishing
      browser_title: 'A page title'
      block: |
        <!-- You probably want to use the header, main & footer components here -->
